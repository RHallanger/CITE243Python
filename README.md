# CITE243Python

This repository hosts resources from `Automate the Boring Stuff With Python`
and my own programs to meet class assignment requirements in CITE 243 at North Idaho College.

## Assigntments
### Chapter 2 - If/Else and Flow Control
`Ch-02_StanleyParableTextAdvenuter` - Replicates a majority of content from the 2013 edition of The Stanley Parable by Galactic Cafe/Crows Crows Crows. Equivalent to a hello world.

### Chapter 3 - Loops
`Ch-03_ForLoop` - Self-explanatory
`Ch-03_WhileLoop` - Self-explanatory

### Chapter 4 & 5 - Functions/Defintions and Debugging
`Ch-04_and_Ch-05_CollatzFunction_with_Debugging` - simple input function that requires a whole positive number to reduce to 1 using collatz.

### Chapter 6 - Lists
`Ch-06_SubnetCalculator` - Uses lists and user input to display relevant information for the user.

### Chapter 7 - Dictionaries
`Ch-07_DictionaryAdventure` - Just a basic program to meet requirements for the assignment, and wanted to test random drop mechanics and inventory management.

### Chapter 8 - Text Manipulation
`Ch-08_ListManipulation` - This was an extra credit assignment that I needed some help on, so to make up I added explanations on everything.

### Chapter 9 - Pattern Matching and Regular Expressions
`Ch-09_StrongPassword` - Stuck mostly to the assignment and wanted to have fun remaking a CLI environment.

### Chapter 10 - Reading and Writing Files
`Ch-10_MadLibs` - Not too different from what was required.

### Chapter 11 - Organizing Files
`Ch-11_OrganizingFiles` - Had to create a program that creates and removes folders and files. So, it is a simple game that requires you to move a file with specific text to a specific location. It doesn't have any real sanity checks to restrict the potential impacts this can have, but if it affects anything serious, it was on the user's part.

### Chapter 13 - Web Scraping
`Ch-13_2048Spammer` - A simple program that opens play2048.co in Firefox and follows a simple loop until it detects failure.

### Chapter 14 & 15 - Excel Spreadsheets & Google Sheets
`Ch-15_EmailFetch.py` performs a simple API fetch to a Google Sheet to gather email responses to a Google Forms.
